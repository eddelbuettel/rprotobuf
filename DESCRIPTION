Title: R Interface to the 'Protocol Buffers' 'API' (Version 2 or 3)
Description: Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an
 efficient yet extensible format. Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all
 of its internal 'RPC' protocols and file formats.  Additional documentation
 is available in two included vignettes one of which corresponds to our 'JSS'
 paper (2016, <doi:10.18637/jss.v071.i02>. Either version 2 or 3 of the
 'Protocol Buffers' 'API' is supported.
