Current TODO list:

o Finish improved vignette / R Journal writeup.

o Push some type coercion hacks done in RProtoBuf upstream to Rcpp
  (Rcpp:as<int> types should work on character strings representing
  numbers, especially for int64s since we don't otherwise have a way
  to represent 64-bit integers in base R).

o Add more packages that depend on or enhance RProtoBuf.

o Improve exception handling to prevent cases where an Rcpp exception
   crashes the interactive R instance.

o Investigate Rcpp Modules support for some classes.  Murray is not
  personally super enthusiastic about this one, as I think it may
  require non trivial changes to Rcpp and/or result in losing some of
  the user-friendliness we've crafted in the explicit RcppExported
  function entry points.  Still, it could be explored and may result
  in significantly fewer lines of code if successful.

o Add a FAQ and other documentation / examples.

o Add more unit tests.

o Explore removing the CLONE() in extractors.cpp.  This makes for
  unusual semantics for any mutable methods of sub-messages.  For
  example, clear(), setExtension(), and probably also update() ( but
  "$<-" on sub-messages is not a problem, it seems).  More details below.

o What should we do when we unload the package?  Any additional
  resources to free that is not currently done?

o finalizers [murray: what is needed here?]

o Clean up formatting / whitespace (its awful, run it all through
  clang-format?)

o Thoroughly audit extensions support and other deeply nested types
  support to ensure everything is implemented as expected.

Stuff I think belongs in additional packages that depend on RProtoBuf,
rather than inside RProtoBuf directly:

    o   http-powered rpc implementation
    o   More as.Message methods

--- Detailed Notes ----

8. CLONE()

--[ examples from Murray illustrating the problem ]--

library(RProtoBuf)
InitGoogle()

if (!exists("protobuf_unittest.TestAllTypes", "RProtoBuf:DescriptorPool")) {
         unittest.proto.file <- system.file("unitTests", "data", "unittest.proto",package="RProtoBuf")
         readProtoFiles(file=unittest.proto.file)
}
test <- new(protobuf_unittest.TestAllTypes)
test$optional_foreign_message <- new(protobuf_unittest.ForeignMessage, c=3)

# Example 1:
test$optional_foreign_message$c
test$optional_foreign_message$clear()
test$optional_foreign_message$c
# didn't clear test$optional_foreign_message$c

# Example 2:
foo <- new(protobuf_unittest.ForeignMessage, c=3)
foo$c
foo$clear()
foo$c
# did clear foo$c

# Example 3:
baz <- test$optional_foreign_message
baz$c
baz$c <- 4
test$optional_foreign_message$c
# still 3, but would be 4 if we removed the CLONE().


Example 1 is currently I think very confusing semantically for users of RProtoBuf with nested messages and I would like to fix that case.  Example 2 works correctly now and would not be affected by this change.  Example 3 would change behavior and could cause problems for users.  Would need to be clearly announced in the NEWS file and to our user list.

--[ Romain's thoughts ]--


`$<-` is the task of setMessageField:

https://github.com/RProtoBuf/RProtoBuf/blob/master/R/00classes.R#L197
https://github.com/RProtoBuf/RProtoBuf/blob/master/src/mutators.cpp#L377

For "$" we could perhaps move to some sort of copy on change semantics (similar to what R does), instead of what we use currently which is more like copy on access.
